# Excel Extraction Research Notes

## Overview
This document contains research notes and findings on extracting unstructured data from Excel files using various approaches, with a focus on eparse and LLM integration.

## Key Research Questions

### 1. Document Provision to LLMs
- **Performance Considerations**: How to efficiently provide large Excel files to LLMs?
- **Chunking Strategies**: What's the optimal way to break down Excel data for LLM processing?
- **Memory Management**: How to handle large datasets without overwhelming the LLM context window?

### 2. Specific Data Extraction
- **Targeted Queries**: How to extract specific data points from complex Excel structures?
- **Table Detection**: Methods for identifying and extracting tables from unstructured layouts
- **Header Recognition**: Techniques for preserving and utilizing row/column headers

### 3. Data Accuracy
- **Validation Methods**: How to verify the accuracy of extracted data?
- **Error Handling**: Strategies for dealing with malformed or inconsistent Excel files
- **Quality Metrics**: Measuring the reliability of extraction results

## Technical Approaches

### Eparse + Unstructured + LLM Pipeline

#### 1. Eparse for Initial Extraction
- **Table Detection**: Automatically identifies structured tables in Excel sheets
- **Header Preservation**: Maintains relationships between headers and data
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports console, SQLite, and PostgreSQL outputs

#### 2. Unstructured Integration
- **Document Partitioning**: Breaks down Excel files into processable chunks
- **Element Extraction**: Identifies different types of content (tables, text, etc.)
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains context and structure information

#### 3. LLM Processing
- **Summarization**: Generate summaries of extracted data
- **Query Processing**: Answer natural language questions about the data
- **Data Analysis**: Perform analytical tasks on the extracted information

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple files efficiently
- **Caching**: Store intermediate results to avoid reprocessing
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple cores for large datasets

### Data Quality
- **Validation Rules**: Implement checks for data consistency
- **Error Recovery**: Handle and report extraction errors gracefully
- **Audit Trails**: Track extraction processes for debugging

### Scalability
- **Memory Management**: Handle large files without memory issues
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient storage and querying of extracted data
- **API Design**: Create reusable interfaces for different use cases

## Future Research Directions

### Advanced Table Detection
- **Machine Learning**: Train models to recognize complex table structures
- **Layout Analysis**: Better understanding of non-standard Excel layouts
- **Multi-sheet Relationships**: Identify connections between different sheets

### LLM Integration Improvements
- **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize prompts for Excel-specific tasks
- **Context Management**: Better handling of large datasets in LLM context
- **Fine-tuning**: Custom models trained on Excel data

### Real-time Processing
- **Streaming**: Process Excel files as they're being created/modified
- **Incremental Updates**: Handle changes to existing files efficiently
- **Live Queries**: Real-time question answering on Excel data
